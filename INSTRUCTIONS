## MA50291: Programming for Data Science
## Exam - 05/12/2024 - University of Bath
## Duration: 3 hours, 12 noon to 3pm
##
## This exam consists of a series of tasks (described below).
##
## The highest mark obtainable for each task is indicated in square 
## brackets, [X]. Marks are allocated following clear, correct, and 
## effective coding. Originality and creativity are especially valued 
## to achieve higher marks. A maximum of 100 marks can be obtained
## if all tasks are completed successfully.
##
## The current directory was cloned by your fork of jfoadi/ExamMA50291.
## It includes a Python package, "cluster_maker", and three test files,
## named "test0_cm.py", "test1_cm.py", and "test2_cm.py". The directory
## includes also the instructions you are reading now, "INSTRUCTIONS".
##
## Carry out the tasks one after the other, following the numeric 
## order. So you should attempt task 2 only after having completed 
## task 1, and so on.

## Tasks:
##
## DONE 1) Modify the package or the file "test0_cm.py" (not both), to make 
## "test0_cm.py" run successfully.  
## [20]
## DONE 2) Modify the package or the file "test1_cm.py" (not both), to make 
## "test1_cm.py" run successfully.
## [10]
## DONE 3) Try and understand what the functions in module
## "data_analyser.py" do and write an appropriate, human-readable,
## docstring for each one of them.
## [10]
## Done - Check 4) Add appropriate exception handling to both functions in
## "data_analyser.py". The exception handling should be effective,
## informative, and should not crash the program.
## [10]
## DONE - 5) Modify the package or the file "test2_cm.py" (not both), to make 
## "test2_cm.py" run successfully.
## [10]
## Done 6) Write a demo file, called "demo_cm.py", that demonstrates
## visually the joint use of define_dataframe_structure() and 
## simulate_data().
## [20]
## Done 7) Add a new function to a new module called 
## "intelligent_clusters.py" that, based on the seed dataframe
## created by define_dataframe_structure(), and using simulate_data(),
## creates groups which are well separated from each other. Among
## the input parameters, make sure to include one that describes group
## separation.
