## Exam - 05/12/2024 - University of Bath
## Duration: 3 hours, 12 noon to 3pm
##
## This exam consists of a series of tasks (described below).
##
## The highest mark obtainable for each task is indicated in square

## effective coding. Originality and creativity are especially valued 
## to achieve higher marks. A maximum of 100 marks can be obtained
## if all tasks are completed successfully.
##
## The current directory was cloned by your fork of jfoadi/ExamMA50291.
## It includes a Python package, "cluster_maker", and three test files,
## named "test0_cm.py", "test1_cm.py", and "test2_cm.py". The directory
## includes also the instructions you are reading now, "INSTRUCTIONS".
##
## Carry out the tasks one after the other, following the numeric 
## order. So you should attempt task 2 only after having completed 
## task 1, and so on.
